# City Sandbox
City Sandbox is a sandbox game created in the Unity engine that allows players to create their own cities. Players can save worlds and share them with others to play. This game was originaly created almost 5 years ago in the summer of 2017 as my first Unity game. The most recent update (Alpha 1.6) has been in the works since September of 2018. After being abandoned for years I decided to finish the update and release it.  
  
You can download the current and past versions of the game through my [website](https://www.ryandw11.com/project/citysandbox). The website also has the example world shown off in the screen shots to download.
